## Features from MySQL 8\.0 Community Edition<a name="AuroraMySQL.8.0-features-community"></a>

 The initial release of Aurora MySQL version 3 is compatible with MySQL 8\.0\.23 Community Edition\. MySQL 8\.0 introduces several new features, including the following: 
+  JSON functions\. For usage information, see [JSON Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-functions.html) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 
+  Window functions\. For usage information, see [Window Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/window-functions.html) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 
+  Common table expressions \(CTEs\), using the `WITH` clause\. For usage information, see [WITH \(Common Table Expressions\)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 
+  Optimized `ADD COLUMN` and `RENAME COLUMN` clauses for the `ALTER TABLE` statement\. These optimizations are called "instant DDL\." Aurora MySQL version 3 is compatible with the community MySQL instant DDL feature\. The former Aurora fast DDL feature isn't used\. For usage information for instant DDL, see [Instant DDL \(Aurora MySQL version 3\)](AuroraMySQL.Managing.FastDDL.md#AuroraMySQL.mysql80-instant-ddl)\. 
+  Descending, functional, and invisible indexes\. For usage information, see [Invisible Indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/invisible-indexes.html), [Descending Indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/descending-indexes.html), and [CREATE INDEX Statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-index-functional-key-parts) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 
+  Role\-based privileges controlled through SQL statements\. For more information on changes to the privilege model, see [Role\-based privilege model](Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Compare-80-v3.md#AuroraMySQL.privilege-model)\. 
+  `NOWAIT` and `SKIP LOCKED` clauses with the `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` statement\. These clauses avoid waiting for other transactions to release row locks\. For usage information, see [Locking Reads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking-reads.html) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 
+  Improvements to binary log \(binlog\) replication\. For the Aurora MySQL details, see [Binary log replication](Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Compare-v2-v3.md#AuroraMySQL.mysql80-binlog)\. In particular, you can perform filtered replication\. For usage information about filtered replication, see [How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules.html) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 
+  Hints\. Some of the MySQL 8\.0â€“compatible hints were already backported to Aurora MySQL version 2\. For information about using hints with Aurora MySQL, see [Aurora MySQL hints](AuroraMySQL.Reference.Hints.md)\. For the full list of hints in community MySQL 8\.0, see [Optimizer Hints](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html) in the *MySQL Reference Manual*\. 

 For the full list of features added to MySQL 8\.0 community edition, see the blog post [The complete list of new features in MySQL 8\.0](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/the-complete-list-of-new-features-in-mysql-8-0/)\. 

 Aurora MySQL version 3 also includes changes to keywords for inclusive language, backported from community MySQL 8\.0\.26\. For details about those changes, see [Inclusive language changes for Aurora MySQL version 3](Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Compare-v2-v3.md#AuroraMySQL.8.0-inclusive-language)\.

 Aurora MySQL version 3 is a prerequisite for all DB instances in an Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 cluster\. Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 includes support for reader instances in a DB cluster, and other Aurora features that aren't available for Aurora MySQL Serverless v1\. It also has faster and more granular scaling than Aurora MySQL Serverless v1\.

## New parallel query optimizations<a name="AuroraMySQL.8.0-features-pq"></a>

 The Aurora parallel query optimization now applies to more SQL operations: 
+  Parallel query now applies to tables containing the data types `TEXT`, `BLOB`, `JSON`, `GEOMETRY`, and `VARCHAR` and `CHAR` longer than 768 bytes\. 
+  Parallel query can optimize queries involving partitioned tables\. 
+  Parallel query can optimize queries involving aggregate function calls in the select list and the `HAVING` clause\. 

 For more information about these enhancements, see [Upgrading parallel query clusters to Aurora MySQL version 3](aurora-mysql-parallel-query.md#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-upgrade-pqv2)\.
